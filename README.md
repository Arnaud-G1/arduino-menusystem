menusystem
==========

An arduino library for implementing a menu system.

Documentation
-------------

Other than the examples included in the library, the following pages might be
useful to you:

* [www.jonblack.org](http://www.jonblack.org/)
* [Arduino forum post](http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,105866.0.html)

Changelog
---------

The library isn't versioned in a coherent way; there are no version numbers you
can refer to. There are, however, a bunch of dates when I made some changes:

**25/05/2012**

* Added support for displaying all current menu items (thanks to arcachofo)
* Added this readme

Note: The changes made for this release break backwards compatability. The
issues are relatively easy to fix.
